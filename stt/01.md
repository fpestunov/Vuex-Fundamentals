00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.726
In Vue.js is quite simple
to work with components

2
00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:07.463
and share data among them,
using events and props,

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.790
especially in small
to medium projects.

4
00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:14.914
Before we dive into what Vuex solves,
we need to set common grounds.

5
00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:19.071
Imagine that we're building
a booking system for a Movie Theater.

6
00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.039
If we are following best practices

7
00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:24.970
by having small components
with single responsibilities,

8
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:28.151
it's very likely to have
something similar to this diagram.

9
00:00:28.314 --> 00:00:32.950
When a user buys a movie ticket,
we will emit a BuyTicket event

10
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:35.007
to the parent MovieRoom component,

11
00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:39.461
which again will emit an event
to the parent Movie component.

12
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:43.701
The Movie component now knows
which movie, room and seat

13
00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:47.018
the user wants, and decreases
the amount of available tickets,

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.333
using props.

15
00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:52.043
In the same time it might emit
an event to the App.vue component.

16
00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:56.112
The App component then
adds the ticket to the cart,

17
00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:59.662
also using props,
and then the ShoppingCart component

18
00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:02.324
passes the item,
which is the actual ticket

19
00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.045
to the ShoppingCartItem.

20
00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:07.058
This structure is fine
for a small or medium application,

21
00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:08.904
but when an application grows,

22
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:12.214
emitting and listening to events
among dozens of components,

23
00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:14.566
might become tedious
and overwhelming.

24
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.533
This is where Vuex
comes to our rescue.

25
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:22.032
Vuex is a state management library
for Vue applications.

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.647
It serves as a centralized data store
for all components in an application.

27
00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.077
In addition, it enforces rules

28
00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:32.518
to ensure that we interact with
the state in a predictable fashion.

29
00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:37.168
This way we can rely on our components
telling Vuex to update the state,

30
00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:39.326
instead of changing the data directly.

31
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.247
If you for instance
add a ticket to the cart,

32
00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:44.409
the cart total will be calculated

33
00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:47.794
and at the same time,
the available tickets will be reduced.

34
00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:50.072
If you went in directly

35
00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.259
and added the ticket
to the ShoppingCart array,

36
00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:54.885
you might forget to remove it
from the available tickets

37
00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:56.400
and thus get a bug.

38
00:01:56.563 --> 00:02:00.760
Another huge benefit of using a
centralized storage library like Vuex,

39
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.906
it that it's debuggable.

40
00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:05.099
Every time Vuex changes the state,

41
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:08.308
the change is tracked
and can be presented in a history log.

42
00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:12.917
There is a common question
on "When to use Vuex".

43
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.515
And as Dan Abramov said,
state management is like glasses.

44
00:02:16.608 --> 00:02:18.150
You know when you need them!

45
00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.860
That said, keep in mind that Vuex

46
00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:22.833
helps you deal
with shared state management

47
00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:26.185
but it also comes with the cost
of more concepts and boilerplate

48
00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:30.055
leading to a trade off between
short term and long term productivity.

49
00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:33.071
So, if your application
is quite small or simple,

50
00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.492
you can stick to managing
state within components.

51
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.633
Then, you can start
moving pieces of state on Vuex

52
00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:43.111
when juggling between the components
feels more complex than Vuex does.

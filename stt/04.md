00:00:00.695 --> 00:00:04.247
Mutations are responsible
for single state changes.

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.211
A single state change would be to
update the products array in our store.

3
00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:10.169
It is really important to understand

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.315
the different responsibilities
of mutations and actions.

5
00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:15.981
In this example,
the fetchProducts action

6
00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:18.498
will be responsible
for making the AJAX call

7
00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:20.559
and the setProducts mutation

8
00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:22.971
will be responsible
for updating the state

9
00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.905
and setting the products array.

10
00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:26.122
It might be tempting

11
00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:28.914
to set the products directly
in the fetchProducts action,

12
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.163
but this goes against
the whole idea of a centralized store.

13
00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:33.789
What we should do instead,

14
00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:36.655
is to call the mutation
that sets the products.

15
00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:39.789
Mutations should be
as simple as possible,

16
00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:43.357
and only responsible for updating
just a piece of the state.

17
00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:46.111
On the other hand,
actions can be complex

18
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:47.749
but never update the state.

19
00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:52.019
If you follow this pattern it is very
likely to have less bugs in your code.

20
00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:55.049
Now, let's take a look
at how a mutation works.

21
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:58.203
Since mutations are responsible
for changing the state,

22
00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:00.561
Vuex will automatically pass the state

23
00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.892
as the first parameter
in every mutation.

24
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.974
We can pass an additional parameter

25
00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:08.026
when calling a mutation,
that will be the payload.

26
00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:11.377
In our example,
the payload is the products.

27
00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:15.817
We can then update the state,
by setting state.products

28
00:01:15.927 --> 00:01:17.480
to payload's products.

29
00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:21.446
Keep in mind that the purpose
of mutations is not to fetch data

30
00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:24.430
or make complex calculations,
but to alter the state.

31
00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:26.680
This should be enough.

32
00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:30.388
Let's export our store and use it
in the ProductList component.

33
00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:36.050
Firstly, we need to import the store.

34
00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:42.727
We don't need the data object anymore

35
00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:45.855
since the products are now
stored globally within the state.

36
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.560
Thus, we need a computed property

37
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:50.680
that will return
the products from the state.

38
00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:55.790
We can access the state,
under store.state

39
00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:57.999
and then grab the products property.

40
00:02:00.418 --> 00:02:04.538
In the created hook we used to update
the local products data property,

41
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.595
but now we want to update
the products under the state.

42
00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.996
You might think
that instead of this.products

43
00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:15.653
we can do
store.state.products=products.

44
00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.506
And while this could work,

45
00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:21.315
you should never update the state
directly, without calling a mutation.

46
00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:25.840
Whenever we say update the state
we mean run a mutation.

47
00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:28.710
And more precisely,
commit a mutation.

48
00:02:28.954 --> 00:02:32.840
To commit a mutation,
we use the store.commit method

49
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.293
and then we pass it
in the name of the mutation.

50
00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:39.211
In this case, the name
of the mutation is setProducts.

51
00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:41.812
We can also pass the payload.

52
00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:44.778
Here, the payload
is the returned products.

53
00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:48.541
If we take a look
at the browser now,

54
00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:50.777
the output is the same
as in the beginning,

55
00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:53.912
but this time we are using
store's state to access the data

56
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:56.178
and a mutation to update the state.

57
00:02:56.344 --> 00:02:58.251
Since every mutation is tracked,

58
00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:00.906
we can see the history
in the Vue devtools plugin.

59
00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:05.606
Notice here that we are also able
to inspect the payload of the mutation

60
00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:08.544
which is the products returned
from the hypothetical API.

61
00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:13.411
To summarize, mutations are wrappers
around individual state changes,

62
00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:15.760
that make them easy
to track and debug.

63
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.236
When using Vuex, you should always
use mutations to update the state.

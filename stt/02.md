WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.445 --> 00:00:05.124
During this course, we will follow
the official Vuex example

2
00:00:05.216 --> 00:00:07.207
by building a shopping cart
from scratch.

3
00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:10.945
This mini application
has a product list and a cart.

4
00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.927
The user can add products
to the cart and later checkout.

5
00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:19.835
To get started, let's create
a fresh project using the vue-cli.

6
00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:23.375
For this course I will use
the vueschool/webpack-template.

7
00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:27.348
Our webpack template is forked
from the official webpack template

8
00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:29.955
to ensure that everyone
is on the same page.

9
00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:33.155
I will name the project shopping-cart.

10
00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:40.094
During the set up process,
I will pick the runtime-only build

11
00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:42.585
and answer "no"
to all other questions.

12
00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:47.736
Next, I'll navigate
to the new project

13
00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:50.144
and install the dependencies
using yarn.

14
00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:56.082
Now, I will run yarn dev
to start the development server.

15
00:00:56.288 --> 00:01:00.984
To kickstart the project we'll copy
the ready made shop.js file,

16
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:02.486
from the official example.

17
00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:05.387
This will give us
some products to play with,

18
00:01:05.496 --> 00:01:09.989
and a few fake or mocked API calls
to fetch and buy the products.

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.633
I will open our newly created project
and I will create a directory API

20
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.387
under src.

21
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.110
Here I will create the shop.js file.

22
00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:26.411
This file will contain
our mocked API calls,

23
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.178
to get the shop products
from an hypothetical server

24
00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:30.879
and process the checkout.

25
00:01:31.093 --> 00:01:32.761
Notice how both functions

26
00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:35.440
accept a callback function
to run on the result.

27
00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:38.311
In addition, the buyProducts function

28
00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:41.120
accepts a callback to run
if something goes wrong.

29
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.644
The success
of the buyProducts is radom

30
00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:47.714
so we have the chance
to work with both cases.

31
00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:51.656
The products array contains
the sample products we will work with.

32
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:55.048
Before we get stared,
I will clean up the boilerplate

33
00:01:55.128 --> 00:01:57.504
by deleting the HelloWorld component.

34
00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:01.637
Since we are making a shopping cart,
we need a list of products.

35
00:02:01.897 --> 00:02:06.146
Let's create a ProductList component,
under the components directory.

36
00:02:08.052 --> 00:02:11.862
Now, let's create the HTML
that will list our products.

37
00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:15.575
Assuming that we have
a products array,

38
00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:18.566
we can iterate through it,
using the v-for directive

39
00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:21.304
and display each product's title
and price.

40
00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:30.811
Let's make our component work,
by grabbing the products.

41
00:02:31.053 --> 00:02:34.257
For now, I will create
a data property products

42
00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:36.170
that will be our products array.

43
00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:41.040
To get the products in real life,
we'd make an AJAX call to an API.

44
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.170
For this example, we have mocked
this call in the shop.js file.

45
00:02:45.437 --> 00:02:48.656
The getProducts function
accepts a callback function to run

46
00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:51.267
passing the products array
as an argument.

47
00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:53.376
Thus, in the ProductList component,

48
00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:55.513
we have to call
the getProducts method.

49
00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.417
We can do that
in the components' created hook.

50
00:02:59.776 --> 00:03:02.242
Everything you put
in the created hook,

51
00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:04.977
will run right after the instance
is created.

52
00:03:05.107 --> 00:03:08.651
In order for us to use the shop,
we need to import it.

53
00:03:11.184 --> 00:03:13.589
Now, we can call
the getProducts function

54
00:03:13.707 --> 00:03:16.693
and when it's done, we can set
the local products property

55
00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:18.166
to the returned data.

56
00:03:21.027 --> 00:03:25.374
Now that we have our product list,
we are ready to use it in App.vue.

57
00:03:25.616 --> 00:03:29.460
I will replace the HelloWorld
component everywhere inside this file,

58
00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:31.284
with our ProductList component.

59
00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:34.278
I will also remove
the logo from the template.

60
00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:36.616
Let's see it in the browser.

61
00:03:36.873 --> 00:03:39.382
As expected, we get a list

62
00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:43.087
that displays the products
returned form the mocked API call.

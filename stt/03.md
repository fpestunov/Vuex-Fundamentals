00:00:01.232 --> 00:00:03.290
Our ProductList component works

2
00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:05.916
but it is tightly coupled
to the business logic.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.751
Additionally, if other components
need to access the fetched products,

4
00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:11.898
they will need to run
the getProducts function.

5
00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:16.814
To get started, let's install Vuex
using yarn add vuex.

6
00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:20.636
Next, we need a container

7
00:00:20.757 --> 00:00:23.116
that will hold
the whole application state.

8
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:27.615
To create a Vuex store, I will create
a directory store under src,

9
00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.755
and within
I will create an index.js file.

10
00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:33.865
Here, we can import Vuex and Vue...

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.124
and then tell Vue to use it.

12
00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:44.867
We can now create a Vuex store,
using the Vuex.Store constructor.

13
00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:48.507
Notice that Store
begins with capital S.

14
00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:51.341
Vuex stores have 5 options.

15
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:55.687
State, mutations,
getters, actions and modules.

16
00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.726
We will review all of them
during this course.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860
To better understand the Store,

18
00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:02.840
you can compare it
with a Vue instance.

19
00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:06.924
For example, the state
is equivalent to the data.

20
00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:11.221
So, within the state,
we could have the products array

21
00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.627
to make it available
to all components.

22
00:01:14.511 --> 00:00:22.605
The getters are equivalent
of computed properties.

23
00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.660
So, here we could have a global
productsCount computed property,

24
00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:26.616
that would return the length
of the products array.

25
00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:31.280
Next, the actions
are the same with methods.

26
00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:35.597
So, here we would perform
the API call to fetch the products.

27
00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.934
Lastly, mutations are something new.

28
00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:44.851
Mutations are responsible for setting
and updating the state.

29
00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:47.770
So, if we want
to set the products array,

30
00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:51.407
we have to call a mutation,
for example setProducts.

31
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.286
We will learn more
about mutations, in the next lesson.

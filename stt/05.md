00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.341
The next thing we will look at,
is Vuex Getters.

2
00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:07.663
You can think of getters
as computed properties.

3
00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.242
Getters are perfect
when we need to filter

4
00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:12.565
or calculate something on runtime.

5
00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:16.662
For example, we may want to show
the products that are not sold out

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.175
or calculate the shopping cart total.

7
00:00:19.647 --> 00:00:21.947
Getters live in the getters option.

8
00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.369
Let's remove this and create a getter

9
00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:26.547
that will give us
the available products.

10
00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:28.385
Similar to mutations,

11
00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:32.084
Vuex automatically passes the state
as the first parameter.

12
00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:36.952
Additionally, Vuex passes all existing
getters as the second parameter.

13
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.776
We know that our products
have an inventory property.

14
00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:44.747
Therefore, we can use
the filter method

15
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.931
to return the products
that are in stock.

16
00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:51.684
So here, I will access
the products under the state

17
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.319
and using the filter,
I will return the products

18
00:00:56.408 --> 00:00:59.732
that the inventory attribute
is greater than zero.

19
00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.463
Now that we have our getter,

20
00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:06.948
we can use it
in the ProductList component.

21
00:01:07.124 --> 00:01:11.062
The getters are accessible
on the store.getters object.

22
00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:14.292
Since we already have
a products computed property,

23
00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:17.762
all we have to do
is to switch out the state.products

24
00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:22.657
with getters. the name of the getter
which is availableProducts.

25
00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:28.088
If we take a look at the browser,
we will see all the products here

26
00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:31.760
since all products inventory
attribute is greater than zero.

27
00:01:31.964 --> 00:01:35.058
Let's change
a product's inventory value to 0,

28
00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:37.405
to make sure that our getter
works as expected.

29
00:01:38.414 --> 00:00:26.128
Switch back to the browser

30
00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:42.333
and now we see
only the available products.

31
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.818
I will revert item's inventory
back to 5.

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.923
Keep in mind
that as computed properties,

33
00:01:49.054 --> 00:01:52.012
getters track their own dependencies
and automatically update

34
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.546
when a dependency changes.

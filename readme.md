# Vuex for Everyone

This Vue.js course is based on the official Vuex example. We'll create a shopping cart with Vue and progressively discover and learn about Vuex features by replacing pieces of the application with mutations, getters, and actions.

**About the course**

In this course you'll learn all there is to know about Vuex by creating a shopping cart from scratch.

We will start off by creating a shopping cart with Vue and then progressively dive into Vuex features as we need them. Piece by piece we'll replace parts of our application with mutations, getters, and actions.

You'll also learn how to break your Vuex store into modules.

After this course, you will know when and how to use getters, mutations, actions and, how to split your Store with modules.

## Meet Vuex

Vuex is a state management library for Vue applications (see diagrams). In this lesson, we'll go through an imaginary app and look at two different ways to handle the application data. By the end of this introductory lesson to Vuex, you'll have a deeper understanding of how Vuex works and the benefit of using Vuex as a centralized store.

We'll also answer the frequently asked question of when to use Vuex.
